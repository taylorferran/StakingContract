# StakingContract

Here I'm creating a very basic staking contract where users can create a staking instance of their own by defining the staking instance name, rewards, duration, and max amount of tokens staked.

After the duration is up, users who stake will be able to withdraw their staked ETH and their rewards, which are given out based on how much ETH they staked and how long for.
